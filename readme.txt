= Getting Started =

It's super easy to get started  with this plugin. Just follow the steps given on [Installation](https://wordpress.org/plugins/gumlet/#installation) page.

= Fix your Google PageSpeed image opportunities =
Is your Google PageSpeed performance test opportunities telling you to:

- Defer Offscreen Images
- Optimize Images
- Properly Size Images
- Serve images with correct dimensions
- Use WebP images
- Or, Serve Images in Next-Gen Formats

Gumlet is the answer with options for automating every aspect of image optimization.

= WooCommerce compatibility =

This plugin is *fully compatible with WooCommerce*. Just go ahead and enable the plugin and your e-commerce store images will be fully optimized.

= Defer Offscreen Images =

Gumlet has lazy load built-in. If your page has a bunch of images below the fold, lazy loading will drastically speed up your page by serving only the images being viewed and delaying others further down the page.

= Automatic Resize =

Gumlet automatically resizes images all your images according to container size and client device. If a person visits your site from an iPhone 6, images will be delivered as per iPhone screen size and DPR. This ensures that unnecessary bandwidth is not wasted by loading huge images on mobile devices.

= WebP Images =

We automatically detect if your users' browser supports WebP images and if it does, we will deliver image in this Next-Gen format. It can reduce the image size by at least 20-30% compared to JPEG.

= Security =

All images are loaded via HTTPS protocol and we use highest security measures to prevent any eavesdropping in communication between client and servers.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Q: How many images can I optimize for free? =
A: We have no cap on number of images that can be optimized through our plugin. You will be charged when your image delivery bandwidth exceeds 1 GB in a given month.

= Q: How can I remove the 1 GB limit? =
A: The limit is not hard enforced. When you cross the limit, we will send you invoice at the start of next month. Please pay it in 20 days and enjoy uninterrupted image delivery experience.

= Q: Does Gumlet delete or replace my original full-size images? =
A: Nope. Your original images always remain as they are and we never touch them. We only resize and compress images on-the-fly and cache it in our servers. You retain full control over your original images and they are never overwritten.

= Q: Iâ€™m a photographer, can I keep all my EXIF data? =
A: Yes! EXIF data stores camera settings, focal length, date, time and location information in image files. Since we never overwrite your original images, your all EXIF data will always be preserved. We only remove the EXIF data when we deliver images to your users.
